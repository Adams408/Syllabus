# Syllabus
1. Create an HTML document that presents the initial part of the class syllabus, just before Grade Range heading. The rendering need not be formatted like my version; you can quite easily get something that looks better.  But this is not the point. The point is to get experience with CSS techniques. Use an internal stylesheet (using a style element in the document head), but also link to an external stylesheet (a file with extension .css). The external stylesheet should import (use the @import command) another style sheet (another file with extension .css). Define rules for at least five elements that appear in the body of the HTML document. And define at least two classes that are used in the body.  Include at least three rules in the internal stylesheet, at least three rules in the external style sheet to which the HTML document links, and at least two rules in the imported stylesheet. Include at least one example where a property value is overridden.
